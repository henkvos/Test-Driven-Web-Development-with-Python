Test-Driven Web Development with Python
=======================================

Code listings form the excellent book of Harry Percival: Test-Driven Web Development with Python

Inspired by the angularjs tutorial (http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial), where every step is a separate branch, \
i deciced to follow Harry's book in the same way and record every step in a separate branch.


I suggest you buy this book from the web site: http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/ , it's worth every penny.

Now go, and obey the testing goat!
