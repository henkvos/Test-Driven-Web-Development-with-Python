Test-Driven Web Development with Python
=======================================

Code listings form the excellent book of Harry Percival: Test-Driven Web Development with Python

Inspired by the angularjs tutorial (http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial), where every step is a separate branch, \
i deciced to follow Harry's book in the same way and record every step in a separate branch.

Every branch is named after the following convention: <Chapter number>-<Page number> , so the first step to run the \
most basic test as listed in the book is branch: 1-3.
The master branch will incorporate all code samples, so to run the first listing do: git checkout 1-3

I suggest you buy this book from the web site: http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/ , it's worth every penny.
Without the book, this repo would probably make no sense at all.

Now go, and obey the testing goat!
